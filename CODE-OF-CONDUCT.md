## TL;DR

- **Do not sell any in game items/rewards/ranks for real world money.** Breaworlds is not your own product to make money off of, and neither is it mine.

- **Do not call yourself the "official" instance of GoldenBedrock/Breaworlds.** Use of the GoldenBedrock name is OK, as long as you dont call yourself official.

- **Always link back to the official repository.** That is located at https://github.com/RealMCoded/GoldenBedrock.

# GoldenBedrock Hosting Code of Conduct

This document outlines rules you should follow when hosting your own GoldenBedrock server. This file will be revised over time.

*Last revised: April 29th 2025*

### Do not sell any in game items/rewards/ranks for real world money.

This includes items like:

- XP Boosters
- Gems
- Verification/Youtube badges
- Items
- Item Bundles
- Staff permissions

Donations are fine for server hosting costs, as long as there is no perks tied to them (Discord roles are fine however, as long as they are **visual only**).

### Do not call yourself the "official" instance of GoldenBedrock/Breaworlds.

The only official Breaworlds server is hosted by Bitdawn Studios, and the only official instance of GoldenBedrock is hosted by stuartwith2ts.

Usage of the name GoldenBedrock is fine however if it's for a small friend server. 

*Note: Later on i'll include an item in the env file to rename your server.*

### Always link back to the official repository.

The official repository for GoldenBedrock is located at https://github.com/RealMCoded/GoldenBedrock.

Please make it clear that you are running GoldenBedrock software on your server connection message (like with the Learn More link).

### Modifications are encouraged!

That's why we're open source, so you can add your own features!

The only rule is that you must make your modifications open source, as marked in the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

A modified version of the Breaworlds 3.8.3 client to be used with the Breaworlds Private Server Manager.

Launching the exe independently does not work. It requires 3 command line arguments in this specific order.
- Server IP
- Server Port
- Server Name

An example launch command would be:
.\Breaworlds-PrivateServer.exe 127.0.0.1 1801 MyLocalServer

It has also been modified to save your login tokens to different files depending on what server name you provide, meaning multiple logins for different servers.
